## Getting Started
## Introduction  
Welcome to **Galactic Gambit**, an immersive app designed to maintain and enhance astronauts' physical health and mental engagement through a series of interactive levels in a microgravity environment. This game blends physical and digital experiences to ensure astronauts stay fit, entertained, and cohesive as they navigate the challenges of space exploration. Before you begin, you will select a unique character name that will represent you throughout your mission.

### Start Your Mission  
In the introductory screen, you will encounter three core options:  
1. **Start Game**: Begin your journey through the levels and challenges designed for astronaut health.  
2. **Meet the AI Health Assistant**: A virtual assistant designed to answer your questions about astronaut health, providing insights and support throughout your mission.  
3. **NASA Health Resource Hub**: A dedicated button that allows you to access valuable NASA data on astronaut health and well-being.  

## Game Levels  
In **Galactic Gambit**, each level is crafted to challenge your physical and mental agility in a zero-gravity environment, ensuring a balance between fun and fitness. There are 10 interactive levels, each with unique objectives and challenges.

### Level 1: Zero-G Word Hunt  
Astronauts collect floating letters in zero gravity to form words on a magnetic board. You will need to use your handheld propulsion devices or push off walls to navigate the cabin and collect the letters within 5 minutes. Score points by forming words and use the wildcard letter to complete any word. The astronaut with the highest score wins.  

### Level 2: Jigsaw Puzzle  
Floating puzzle pieces are scattered around the cabin, and it’s a race to assemble a 3D puzzle on a magnetic board. Quick thinking and precise movement are essential as astronauts gather pieces in zero gravity. The first to complete their puzzle wins.

### Level 3: Zero-G Dodgeball  
In this fast-paced game, one astronaut must avoid being hit by soft balls thrown by other players. Using handheld propulsion devices, the dodger must float around the cabin, dodging balls to avoid penalties. The astronaut with the fewest penalties at the end of the game wins.

### Level 4: Orb Chase  
Colorful orbs are released into the cabin, and astronauts must collect as many as possible within a time limit. Each orb has a different point value, and players need to decide which orbs to prioritize. The astronaut who collects the most points wins.

### Level 5: Target Practice  
Using foam darts, astronauts aim at floating targets dispersed around the cabin. Some targets drift slowly, while others move unpredictably. Points are awarded based on accuracy, and the astronaut with the highest score wins.

### Level 6: Space Scavenger Hunt  
In this scavenger hunt, various objects are hidden around the cabin. Astronauts must locate and retrieve these items using their problem-solving skills. With limited time, the fastest astronaut to collect all the items wins.

### Level 7: Floating Maze Navigation  
A floating maze is set up in the cabin, and astronauts must navigate through it without touching the walls. Time penalties are given for any contact with the maze. The fastest astronaut to complete the maze with the fewest penalties wins.

### Level 8: Microgravity Tug-of-War  
Two astronauts hold an elastic rope on opposite sides of the cabin. Instead of pulling each other, they use their core strength to pull themselves toward a floating target in the center of the cabin. The first astronaut to reach the target wins.

### Level 9: Floating Tower Build  
Astronauts must stack floating objects to build the tallest tower in zero gravity. The challenge lies in precision and stability, as the tower must stay upright despite the movements in the cabin. The astronaut with the tallest, most stable tower wins.

### Level 10: Zero-G Obstacle Course  
Astronauts navigate through an obstacle course made of floating barriers and foam rings without touching them. Each touch incurs a time penalty. The astronaut who completes the course the fastest, with the fewest penalties, wins the game.

## Educational Goals  
Galactic Gambit aims to achieve several goals through its gameplay:  
- **Physical Health Maintenance**: Ensures astronauts remain physically fit and agile in the zero-gravity environment.
